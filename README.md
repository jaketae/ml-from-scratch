# Machine Learning From Scratch

This repository contains my implementations of various machine learning algorithms from scratch. 

## Motivation

A quote from Richard Feynman:

> What I cannot create, I do not understand.

By constructing algorithms from the ground up, one can glean meaningful insights on how machine learning actually works. 

## Algorithms

Currently, the following list of algorithms have been implemented.

- [Linear Regression](https://jaketae.github.io/study/linear-regression/)
- [Logistic Regression](https://jaketae.github.io/study/logistic-regression/)
- [Naive Bayes](https://jaketae.github.io/study/naive-bayes/)
- [K-Nearest Neighbors](https://jaketae.github.io/study/KNN/)
- [Principal Component Analysis](https://jaketae.github.io/study/pca/)
- K-Means Clustering: *Post coming soon!*


For detailed explanations on the mathematics behind each model, visit the links to my blog, where I lay out a step-by-step derivation for each algorithm. The code introduced in the blog have been modified as class-based implementations for better presentation and readability.

More documentation and models to come!
